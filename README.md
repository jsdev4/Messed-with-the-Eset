# Messed-with-the-Eset
Mini video-game made in AS3 using flashpunk. Cyberpunk styled. Images and sprites were collected in free domains and properly edited for educational purposes. Same situation about the sound and music.
To compile you need to put the .net folder (libraries of flashpunk) in the main folder of this project. 
Feel free to comment and make suggestions!
